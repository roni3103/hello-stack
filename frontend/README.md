# The Frontend

This is a JavaScript front end with jquery for some utility functions. It does not use a front end framework to help organize the application but there are many to choose from.

Checkout [../docs/frontend/README.md](../docs/frontend/README.md) for a more in depth look at what should and shouldn't be done in the front end and how it talks to our API backend.
