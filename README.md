# Hello Stack

![Pancakes stack. Get it? We're talking about an application stack but this is a stack of pancakes. Sigh, the joke is never good if you have to explain it.](frontend/images/pancakes-256.png)

A basic web app stack to use as an example when explaining the core components of a web app. The application is a Vanilla JavaScript front end, Node API backend using Express and Mongo DB. However the repository is less about which frameworks or database to used and more about where each area hooks up and why.

Check out the source and look through the [docs readmes](docs/README.md) to make the most of the resources in this repo.
