# The Backend

This is a NodeJS + Express backend that we use to receive and respond to API requests from out frontend. Comments and descriptions in the code are very much geared to Node and Express but there are other options for a backend in both language and frameworks to use.

Checkout [../docs/backend/README.md](../docs/backend/README.md) for a more language and framework agnostic look at what the role of a backend API is.
