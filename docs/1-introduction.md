# Introduction

Welcome the Hello Stack app docs. These markdown files are here to document each aspect of a simple web application stack. The focus is not on what language, frameworks or database is used but rather why each component of a web application exists and what its role should be.

The stack is split into 3 main components, these are the *frontend*, *backend* and *database*. While some choices on technologies have been made the ideas discussed should translate fairly well across other stacks for a web application.

# Contribute

The idea is to end up with a resource for coding starters who already have picked up a foundation in programming but now want to put the pieces together and build an application. Any pull requests to the application or documentation that helps this goal are much appreciated.

Documentation changes should be clear and straightforward enough for someone new to coding to grasp. What may seem like a common widely known practice may need to be explained more than initially thought. At the same time keep things brief and try to focus on the most important information to convey.

Application changes should add to a good basic foundation of best practices that are as agnostic as possible. We're not trying to convey the latest and greatest framework or making the most complex and resilient application. Its just a foundation for learning an applications stack components and how they interact with each other.
